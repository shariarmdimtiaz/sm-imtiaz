However, there are some limitations such as a low resolution, lack of motion parallax, and a narrow viewing angle. In this paper, we propose a method to implement a multi-view display system that provides a 3D image in high resolution. The original setup is composed of a stereoscopic 3D display panel and a head tracking camera. The directional view image of a 3D object is captured by a camera array and shown on a stereoscopic 3D display.",
